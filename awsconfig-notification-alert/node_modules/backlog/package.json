With backlog, you can recover your node.js file's code by simply setting the key 'backup' to true.\n\n## Using backlog\n### Install\nInstall using npm\n```\nnpm install backlog\n```\n\nYou can also install by cloning this repository and putting it in the `node_modules` directory of your project.\n\n### Setting it up\nbacklog is very simple to use. In just a few lines, you can backup your code and retrieve it.\n\nUse the library with require()\n```\nvar backlog = require('backlog')\n```\n\nNext, you must set the settings for backup, there are three options in the settings: backup, message, and logFile. This file will be called **app.js**\n\n```\n//`app.js` file\n\nvar backlog = require('backlog');\n\nbacklog.settings({\n\tmessage: 'This is my first file change.'\n});\n\nbacklog.init();\n```\nRun this file with `node app.js`\n\nThis backlog is initiated without a backup save. **The backlog.settings() function is optional but backlog.init() is required and what initiates backlog**. The logs will be written in a file named 'back.log'. Go to back.log and you'll see something similar to this...\n\n`back.log` file output \n```\n{\n  \"1\": {\n    \"filename\": \"app.js\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"Tue Jun 11 2013 09:20:43\",\n    \"message\": \"This is my first file change.\",\n    \"char_count\": 476,\n    \"line_count\": 18\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Backing up the file\nUse `backup: true` in the settings.\n```\n//`app.js` file\n\nvar backlog = require('backlog')\n\nbacklog.settings({\n\tbackup: true,\n\tmessage: 'This is my second file change.'\n});\n\nbacklog.init()\n```\n\nWhen you run the app.js file again with `node`, the output in your log file should now look similar to this.\n\n```\n{\n  \"1\": {\n    \"filename\": \"app.js\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"Tue Jun 11 2013 09:20:43\",\n    \"message\": \"This is my first file change.\",\n    \"char_count\": 476,\n    \"line_count\": 18\n  },\n  \"2\": {\n    \"filename\": \"app.js\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"Tue Jun 11 2013 10:05:37\",\n    \"message\": \"This is my second file change.\",\n    \"char_count\": 477,\n    \"line_count\": 18,\n    \"encoded\": \"93,0,0,1,0,-78,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,59,24,74,-90,39,85,122,99,28,-17,117,36,-123,91,8,119,-72,84,-96,-58,80,10,21,39,-19,46,-73,103,-46,-78,-25,-126,7,-66,24,13,-114,80,66,-29,-115,-47,117,34,-31,-45,-100,-114,45,-1,-46,-61,121,93,-109,-91,106,27,-7,-52,116,-63,124,-99,-117,47,62,-40,-109,109,67,-94,97,-88,121,-19,1,97,-115,-58,47,103,69,-72,121,80,-41,-53,50,6,1,-61,83,76,102,-67,-108,109,-85,10,-81,-81,99,-34,87,2,-12,13,56,-63,61,-88,-6,115,-94,-51,65,17,-40,2,100,-118,-107,-39,61,37,-88,-58,6,84,-105,29,-36,-100,-63,108,-90,71,-96,-22,94,-102,-104,-95,-4,95,33,59,-6,-82,52,-14,102,12,94,73,-37,-81,85,65,-2,-113,-105,22,54,49,-26,-81,51,-29,-126,-51,10,127,-4,-83,-18,104,83,-10,-35,58,68,-89,10,-89,28,22,30,-53,-124,112,18,37,32,35,86,-63,-114,14,3,120,11,1,37,-48,-121,-61,87,-57,-43,40,-77,73,48,81,16,-46,-124,-48,-101,-65,-47,-123,2,-52,-88,-72,-25,89,83,-99,-101,-102,102,39,-42,-119,-108,54,39,96,113,-19,106,-107,-27,-91,-8,-74,17,-30,-119,6,65,-33,-44,74,125,-67,79,50,-30,100,-83,103,88,-25,19,-10,-103,90,59,-1,89,34,-24,-8,-43,89,-96,-26,-6,61,113,90,57,12,125,13,-20,-34,112,-4,85,43,-122,121,125,52,-91,12,-111,-121,-81,-1,-54,77,-104,0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAs you see above, there is a new index called '2' with a new key. The encoded key has a value of the encoded text of the source file you backed up.\n\n### Retrieving your backups\nThe encoded key is a compressed version of your code. In order to retrieve this code in a new file, you must run this line in your code. **If your backed up code was the 2nd index in the log file, as seen above, then retrieving the code would look like this.**\n```\nbacklog.retrieve(2, 'back.log');\n```\n\nThe first parameter of retrieve() is used to resemble the index in your log's json. The second parameter resembles the file name of your log.\n\nA new file named 2_app.js, containing your backed up code, will appear in your directory with your original app.js. \n\n### Change the file name\nlogFile is a key used to represent the name of your log file, thus replacing the default back.log.\n```\nbacklog.settings({\n\tlogFile: 'jared.log',\n\tmessage: 'This is my code that has this thing in it...'\n});\n```\n\n\n## API\n### backup.settings(settings)\n'settings' should be a associative array (dictionary) with three optional keys, backup (set to a boolean), logFile (set to a string), message (set to a string). Setting **must** always be before init()\n\n### backup.init()\nThis function is what initiates backlog. Your file should ideally end with it.\n\n### backup.retrieve(key, file)\nThis is the function for retrieving the encoded source. Key parameter is the key for the backed up code you want to get back (should be an integer more than 0) and can be a string. file parameter represents the backlog generated log file you want to retrieve the code from.\n\n### backup.clearLog(file)\nThis function is simply used for clearing your backlog generated logs.\n\n## Contact\nIf you would like to contact me for further information on the project, see the info below.\n\nEmail: jawerty210@gmail.com\n\nGithub: jawerty\n\nTwitter: @jawerty\n\nBlog: <http://wrightdev.herokuapp.com>\n\n## License\nLicensed under the MIT License\n",
